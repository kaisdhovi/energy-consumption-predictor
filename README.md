# energy-consumption-predictor
📈 SVR-based machine learning app to predict household electricity usage using the UCI Household Electric Power Consumption dataset. Built with Streamlit.
A machine learning project that uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict household electricity consumption based on the Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset.

📊 Project Overview
This project aims to:

Analyze and preprocess time-series energy usage data.
Train an SVR model to predict future power consumption.
Provide a simple and interactive UI using Streamlit for users to test predictions based on historical input.

📁 Features
Data cleaning and feature engineering
SVR model training and evaluation (MSE, RMSE)
Visualization of prediction results vs actual
Streamlit web interface for real-time input and prediction

🧪 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for plots)

📂 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Format: .txt , contains date-time and power usage features
